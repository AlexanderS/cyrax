=======
 Cyrax
=======

Cyrax is a static site generator using Jinja2_ template engine.

It's inspired from Jekyll_ and Hyde_ site generators and started when I realized
that I'm dissatisfied with both of them by different reasons. When I tried to
come up with name I remembered my favourite character from Mortal Kombat 3 so
here we go.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cyrax depends on Jinja2 and pyYAML_ libraries, so either install them as your
distribution prefers (they are present in most of major distributions,
particularly Debian and MacPorts), or use ``easy_install``::

   sudo easy_install jinja2
   sudo easy_install pyYAML

Get the cyrax by either cloning repository_ or downloading an archive_.

Usage
~~~~~

Run ``./main.py``.
